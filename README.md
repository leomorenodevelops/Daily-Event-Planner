# Daily-Event-Planner

## Description
This is a project that allowed me to use HTML and CSS starter code, combined with my very own written JavaScript code. I used these skills to make a Daily Event Planner. This is a website that displays the current time and allows the user to plan out their busy schedule by writing an event description on 1 hour time blocks (while following real time). Once the user inputs the text for that hour block, they can then click the save button to save their text. That data is then stored in the local storage which allows user to refresh the page without losing any data entered.

During this project I learned how to use JQuery and the differences and advantages over just using JavaScript. I was able to implement moment.js to display the current time and allowing the planner to work off real time to show the user past, present and future events.
